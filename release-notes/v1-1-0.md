## Changes
- ### aligem jobs status
  - Compact one-liner implemented as default. For detailed (previously used) list, use full (`-f`) flag
- ### aligem jobs kill
  - Default kills (only) subjobs in 'DONE' state
  - Sequential killing (first master then subjobs) introduced with resubmit (`-r`) flag. In this case, all failed jobs are resubmitted first.
